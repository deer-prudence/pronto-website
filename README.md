# Pronto! Documentation
This website was built using React. The next steps are as follows:
1. Implement [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/integration-builder)
2. Maintain accisibility using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) standards.
3. Add application portal to allow users to apply for grants.


This code was built using AWS Cloud9. In order to run it, you will need to install React (`npm install react`) as well as React native (`npm install react-native`).  Installing React native may require additional dependency [installations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49667452/module-not-found-cant-resolve-react-native-react-native). Please feel free to contact me, deer-prudence, with any concerns.
